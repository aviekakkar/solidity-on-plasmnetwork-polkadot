## Plasm Network
Plasm Network is a multi-virtual machines scalable smart contract platform on Polkadot supporting cutting-edge layer2 solutions. Recently, Plasm Network announced the vision of an Ethereum compatible network and supported the Ethereum Virtual Machine on it’s testnet. Polkadot Relaychain doesn’t support smart contract functionalities by design. Thus, all DApps developers need at least one Parachain that supports smart contracts. When it comes to smart contracts, we believe that scalability is the most fundamental issue we have to solve. That’s why we are implementing layer2 solutions on the top of Plasm Network.
